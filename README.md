# Introduction
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the public domain Iris Species dataset, which is used in data visualization and machine learning.
The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships, patterns, and distribution among sepal and petal measurements across the three Iris species.

# Objectives
- Perform an intial inspection of the dataset and verify its structure, data types, and any missing values.
- Descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of each feature.
- Data visualization with histogram, pair plot, box plot, heatmap, and scatter plot.

# Conclusion
The analysis revealed strong correlations between petal width and petal lenght, as well as the useness of these features for differentiating between species. Pair plot and box plot highlighted how Setosa is separable from the other two species, while Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap.
